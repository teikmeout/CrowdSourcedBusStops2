## Google Maps location saving

This is a web app that will allow users to save specific locations and mark them with the public transportation option that they are using.

### Introduction
Some countries do not have a correct render of their public transportation information in Google Maps. Sometimes this is because of Private companies running these services not providing that information, but can also due to the lack of resources to provide it. 

### Process
The main idea of this app would be to collect information from different users and confirm different public transportation pick up spots.

### Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Node.js
- Express
- Path
- MongoDB

### Wireframes
(In progress)
